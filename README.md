# Weather web application
Welcome to my Weather Website! This web application allows users to easily check the current weather in any city around the world. Whether you're planning a trip or just curious about the weather in a different location, this website provides a user-friendly interface to access real-time weather data. It uses the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch weather data and display it on the website via HTML, CSS and Javascript.

## Using the Weather Website is straightforward:
* Enter the name of the city you want to check the weather for in the input field.
* Click the "Search" button or press the "Enter" key to initiate the search.
* The website will display the city name and current temperature in Celsius.
* If an invalid city name is entered, an alert will inform the user to try again.

## Technology used
